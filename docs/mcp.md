# MCP Server

`oracle-mcp` is a minimal MCP stdio server that mirrors the Oracle CLI. It shares session storage with the CLI (`~/.oracle/sessions` or `ORACLE_HOME_DIR`) so you can mix and match: run with the CLI, inspect or re-run via MCP, or vice versa.

The server uses MCP SDK v2 and serves both modern and legacy protocol clients over stdio. Existing tool inputs, defaults, structured outputs, and `oracle-session://` resources are preserved. The SDK owns protocol negotiation and transport shutdown; the server definition is shared between protocol generations. HTTP transport, authentication, subscriptions, and protocol task APIs remain separate from this migration.

## Let Them Fight

Claude Code can call `oracle-mcp` and ask a subscription-backed ChatGPT browser session for a second opinion. Use the `chatgpt-pro-heavy` preset when you want a compact MCP request that targets ChatGPT browser mode, the current Pro picker alias, and Pro Extended thinking time. The preset is intentionally boring at the API layer: it is a shortcut for existing browser-mode fields, not a new model id.

## Tools

### `chatgpt_image`

- Inputs: `prompt` (required), `files?: string[]` for reference images/assets, `outputPath?: string`, `aspectRatio?: string`, `model?: string`, plus browser controls such as `browserThinkingTime`, `browserModelLabel`, `browserModelStrategy`, `browserArchive`, `browserKeepBrowser`, and `dryRun`.
- Behavior: convenience wrapper for ChatGPT browser image generation. It forces `engine:"browser"`, sets `generateImage` for the existing image-aware wait/download path, and defaults `browserAttachments:"always"` when files are provided so reference images are uploaded instead of pasted.
- Output: returns the normal session metadata plus `requestedOutputPath` and `structuredContent.images[]` with saved local paths, MIME type, size, dimensions, and ChatGPT file id when available. Signed source/download URLs are not returned. If `outputPath` is omitted, Oracle picks a unique file under `ORACLE_HOME_DIR/generated/`.
- Output path safety: agent-supplied `outputPath` must resolve under `ORACLE_HOME_DIR/generated` by default; traversal and symlink escapes are rejected. This keeps MCP writes away from Oracle config, session metadata, and browser profile state. Set `ORACLE_MCP_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_OUTPUT=1` to allow writing elsewhere as an explicit operator decision. Omit `outputPath` to use the safe default.
- Remote browser services: image output requires the host's `generatedImages: true` capability with artifact protocol v1. Current clients send image intent without exposing their filesystem path to the host; the host captures into its own session directory, then the client transfers the image to the requested local output path. Clients reject image requests before sending prompts or attachments to older hosts and report that the host needs an upgrade; text-only calls remain compatible.

```json
{
  "prompt": "Create a 9:16 App Store screenshot background for a focus timer.",
  "files": ["./reference-screen.png"],
  "aspectRatio": "9:16"
}
```

### `consult`

- Inputs: `prompt` (required), `files?: string[]` (globs), `model?: string` (defaults to CLI), `engine?: "api" | "browser"` (optional; Oracle follows CLI defaults: `ORACLE_ENGINE` and the effective config first, then API when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set, otherwise browser), `waitForCompletion?: boolean`, `slug?: string`.
- Presets: `preset?: "chatgpt-pro-heavy"` applies browser mode + current Pro model alias + extended thinking, unless the request overrides those fields.
- Browser-only extras: `browserAttachments?: "auto"|"never"|"always"`, `browserBundleFiles?: boolean`, `browserBundleFormat?: "auto"|"text"|"zip"`, `browserThinkingTime?: "light"|"standard"|"extended"|"extra-high"|"pro"|"heavy"`, `browserResearchMode?: "deep"`, `browserFollowUps?: string[]`, `browserArchive?: "auto"|"always"|"never"`, `browserKeepBrowser?: boolean`, `browserModelLabel?: string`, `browserModelStrategy?: "select"|"current"|"ignore"`, `generateImage?: string`, `outputPath?: string`.
- Browser file uploads: one text/source file stays native, while multiple text/source files default to one bundle. `browserBundleFormat:"auto"` keeps flattened text for text-only uploads and uses ZIP when raw files are present. Set `browserBundleFormat:"zip"` for a filesystem tree, or `browserBundleFiles:true` to force one all-file bundle.
- Dry runs: set `dryRun: true` to preview the resolved request without creating a session or touching the browser.
- Behavior: starts a session and runs it with the chosen engine. The compatibility default is `waitForCompletion:true`, which returns final output + metadata in the same call. Set `waitForCompletion:false` to launch a local detached worker and return a durable `sessionId` immediately. If API mode fails because `OPENAI_API_KEY` is missing and you have ChatGPT Pro, retry with `engine: "browser"` or `preset: "chatgpt-pro-heavy"` to use your signed-in ChatGPT session instead of an API key.
- Local browser consultations select ChatGPT or Gemini from the model, including detached workers. Remote browser services support ChatGPT only; Gemini requests fail before submission.
- Logging: emits MCP logs (`info` per line, `debug` for streamed chunks with byte sizes). If browser prerequisites are missing, returns an error payload instead of running.
- Research mode: set `browserResearchMode:"deep"` for broad public-web research and cited reports. Use normal browser runs with `gpt-5.5-pro` + `browserThinkingTime:"extended"` for legacy Pro Extended code review, `gpt-5.6-sol` + `browserThinkingTime:"extra-high"` for Extra High, or `gpt-5.6-sol` + `browserThinkingTime:"pro"` when you explicitly want the current Pro effort tier.
- Multi-turn consults: set `browserFollowUps:["Challenge your recommendation", "Give the final decision"]` to keep one ChatGPT browser conversation open and ask sequential follow-up prompts. Use one-shot calls for narrow bugs and exact file-set reviews; use multi-turn for ambiguous architecture/product decisions where a challenge pass and final recommendation are useful; use Deep Research for broad public-web work with citations. Oracle never invents follow-ups automatically.
- Archiving: set `browserArchive:"auto"|"always"|"never"` to control ChatGPT conversation cleanup. `auto` archives only successful browser one-shots after local artifacts are saved, and skips project, Deep Research, multi-turn, failed, and incomplete sessions.
- Web Search: set `engine:"browser", browserResearchMode:"search"` to explicitly select the English ChatGPT Web Search control. Selection and the staged prompt must be verified before submission. This pilot uses locally controlled Chrome, including attach-running/direct remote Chrome; remote browser-service execution is refused until capability negotiation is available.
- ChatGPT image generation: set `engine:"browser"` and `generateImage` to a path under `ORACLE_HOME_DIR/generated` to use the same image-aware wait/download path as CLI `--generate-image`. Saved files are returned in `structuredContent.images` and recorded as session artifacts; multiple images save as numbered siblings. Agent-supplied `generateImage` / `outputPath` are constrained to that generated-output directory by default (set `ORACLE_MCP_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_OUTPUT=1` to allow external paths).

#### Long browser consults from agents

Browser-backed GPT-5.5 Pro and Deep Research consults can legitimately run for many minutes. Start them with `waitForCompletion:false`, then call `wait` with the returned `sessionId`; this keeps the run alive independently of either MCP request and avoids agent-side polling. Start with `dryRun:true` when configuring a new agent, prefer `preset:"chatgpt-pro-heavy"` or `engine:"browser"` explicitly, and inspect the shared session store before retrying a prompt. Detached consult launch currently requires local execution; remote browser-service callers should keep `waitForCompletion:true`. If the browser control plan says Oracle will launch visible Chrome, use attach/remote Chrome when the operator is actively using the computer.

```json
{
  "prompt": "Review this architecture",
  "files": ["src/**"],
  "preset": "chatgpt-pro-heavy",
  "waitForCompletion": false
}
```

Then wait without polling:

```json
{ "id": "<sessionId from consult>", "timeoutMs": 900000 }
```

#### ChatGPT images from agents

For generated images, pass an explicit `generateImage` path. That opt-in is important because it switches the browser wait loop to watch for ChatGPT image artifacts instead of only assistant text. The path must resolve under `ORACLE_HOME_DIR/generated` unless `ORACLE_MCP_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_OUTPUT=1` is set.

```json
{
  "engine": "browser",
  "model": "gpt-5.5-pro",
  "prompt": "Create a 9:16 App Store screenshot background for a focus timer.",
  "generateImage": "${ORACLE_HOME_DIR}/generated/focus-timer-bg.png"
}
```

The MCP response includes `structuredContent.images[]` with the saved file path, MIME type, size, dimensions, and ChatGPT file id when available. Signed source/download URLs remain internal.

### `sessions`

- Inputs: `{id?, hours?, limit?, includeAll?, detail?}` mirroring `oracle status` / `oracle session`.
- Behavior: without `id`, returns a bounded list of recent sessions. With `id`/slug, returns a summary row; set `detail: true` to fetch full metadata, log, and stored request body.

### `wait`

- Inputs: `id` (required session id or slug), `timeoutMs?: number`.
- Behavior: blocks until the durable session status becomes `completed`, `partial`, `error`, or `cancelled`, then returns the final log tail and artifact/model/image summaries. It uses filesystem notifications with a low-frequency fallback and rereads session metadata after every wakeup.
- Timeout semantics: omit `timeoutMs` to wait indefinitely, set a positive value to bound only this MCP call, or set `0` for an immediate snapshot. A timeout returns `waitStatus:"timed_out"`; caller cancellation, transport closure, host-imposed request deadlines, or timeout never cancels the Oracle worker. Call `wait` again with the same `id` to continue.

### `project_sources`

- Inputs: `operation: "list"|"add"`, `chatgptUrl?: string`, `files?: string[]`, `dryRun?: boolean`, `confirmMutation?: boolean`, `browserKeepBrowser?: boolean`.
- Behavior: manages the ChatGPT Project Sources tab through local browser automation. v1 is intentionally append-only: it can list existing sources and add files, but it cannot delete, replace, or sync.
- Safety: `add` requires `confirmMutation: true` unless `dryRun: true`. This keeps agent callers from mutating a persistent ChatGPT Project by accident.
- Workflow: use this when Claude Code, Codex, or another MCP host needs a durable shared context file in a ChatGPT Project. Use `consult` when you want an actual model answer.

## Resources

- `oracle-session://{id}/{metadata|log|request}` — read-only resources that surface stored session artifacts via MCP resource reads.

## Background / detach behavior

- `consult` remains synchronous by default for compatibility. Set `waitForCompletion:false` to detach any local API or browser run explicitly, then use `wait` to attach a bounded or unbounded waiter to its durable session state.
- The detached worker owns the run. Ending or timing out a `wait` call only releases that waiter; it does not stop the worker. CLI inspection and reattachment remain available through `oracle session <id>` / `oracle status`.

### Lifecycle compatibility check

After building, run `node scripts/mcp-lifecycle-proof.mjs` to exercise SDK v1,
SDK v2 legacy, and SDK v2 modern clients through both executable entrypoints.
It starts real detached CLI workers against a local API fixture and checks caller
timeouts, request cancellation, transport reconnects, durable completion, and a
single provider submission. The standard test suite also runs this matrix.
For a real OpenAI run, add `--live-key-file <private-key-file>`; the harness uses
an authenticated upstream request and delays its reply until the lifecycle
assertions finish. This does not exercise signed-in browser execution.
